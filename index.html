      <h2>What is Track and Field?</h2>
      <h4><a href="http://www.usatf.org/">USA Track and Field</a></h4>
      Track and field is a sport with many different events. However,
      this website will focus on the running events (referred to as track events).
      Competitions take place outside or inside on a 400-meter track (the track
      is shaped like an oval.) The winter track and field season is from late
      November to early March. Spring track starts in late March and ends in late June.
